---Pre Project---
This project is the first of many in my studies of the Odin Project web course.

Using skills I have learned such as 
1)HTML
2)CSS
3)GIT
4)Web Browser Dev Tools

I will create a simple, non-functioning, replica of the Google Homepage to better understand basic layout structure of a website.
