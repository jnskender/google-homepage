---Pre Project---  
This project is the first of many in my studies of the Odin Project web course.

Using skills I have learned such as  
1)HTML  
2)CSS  
3)GIT  
4)Web Browser Dev Tools

I will create a simple, non-functioning, replica of the Google Homepage to better understand basic layout structure of a website.

--Post Project--  
After completing this basic layout project I have learned common CSS layout techniques as well as the value of Firefox Dev Tools. I feel more confident in my ability to use HTML and CSS in conjuction with Git to create well organized static pages.
